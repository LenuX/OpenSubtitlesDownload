{"name":"OpenSubtitlesDownload.py","tagline":"This small software is designed to help you find and download subtitles for your favorite videos!","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nOpenSubtitlesDownload.py is a small software written in python, built to help you quickly find and download subtitles for your favorite videos. It can be used as a nautilus script, or as a regular application working under GNOME or KDE desktop environments. You can also use it in full CLI (Command Line Interface) mode!\r\n\r\nThe subtitles search is done by precisely identifying your videos files, not by using filename but by generating a unique hash signature from your files. This way, you have more chance to find the exact subtitles corresponding to your videos, avoiding synchronization problems between the subtitles and the soundtrack.\r\n\r\nThe subtitles search and download service is powered by [opensubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org). Big thanks to their hard work on this amazing project! Be sure to [give them your support](http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/support) if you appreciate the service provided, they sure need donations for handling the ever growing hosting costs!\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Query subtitles in more than 60 different languages for documentaries, movies, TV shows and more...\r\n- Query subtitles in multiple languages at once.\r\n- Use a GNOME/GTK or KDE/Qt GUI depending on your desktop environment, or just use the CLI!\r\n- Select multiple video files to search their subtitles simultaneously.\r\n- Select different target languages to search them simultaneously.\r\n- Detect valid video files (using mime types and file extensions).\r\n- Detect correct video titles by computing hash file signatures, not by reading the filenames.\r\n- Download subtitles automatically if only one is available, select the one you want otherwise.\r\n- Rename downloaded subtitles to match source video file. Possibility to append the language code to the file name (ex: movie_en.srt).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nQuick installation as a nautilus script, under GNOME 3 desktop environment:\r\n\r\n> $ git clone https://github.com/emericg/OpenSubtitlesDownload.git  \r\n> $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/  \r\n> $ cp OpenSubtitlesDownload/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py  \r\n> $ chmod u+x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py  \r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- python (version 2 or 3)\r\n- zenity (only for GNOME based desktop environments)\r\n- kdialog (only for KDE based desktop environments)\r\n- basic unix tools: wget & gzip (subtitles downloading), ps & grep (gui autodetection)\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Emeric Grange <emeric.grange@gmail.com> lead developer & maintainer\r\n- Gui13 for his work on the arguments parsing\r\n- Tomáš Hnyk <tomashnyk@gmail.com> for his work on the 'multiple language' feature\r\n- Carlos Acedo <carlos@linux-labs.net> for his work on the original script\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOpenSubtitlesDownload.py is a free software released under the GPL v3 license <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>\r\n","google":"UA-1353027-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
